## World Cup 2014 Group Finish Calculator

* A simple calculator for the last round of group matches
* Only Group G is featured on ShinyApp due to time constraints (but the idea works!)

--- .class #id bg:yellow

## Random R computation (yeah like really random)

```{r}
sum(1:100)
```

--- .h3 #id

## Why use the app?

- Ease of use
- To understand how ridiculously difficult it is to recover after two losses
- Mourn for Espanol

--- .class #id

## Closing
